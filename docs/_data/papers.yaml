- title: "Modeling NPC Perception Using Supervised Learning"
  description: "This study explores the use of supervised learning models to approximate visual perception in non-playable characters (NPCs) within video games. By creating a dataset of scenarios where an NPC should or should not perceive a player, and training a feed-forward neural network with this data, the research aims to improve the realism of NPC awareness and interaction. The implementation uses the Godot engine for game development and PyTorch for the perception model."

- title: "Interactive Deep Learning for CT Bone Segmentation"
  description: "This study explores the integration of user-provided hints with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the segmentation of discrete bone fragments in CT volumes. It evaluates the performance of the combined interactive deep learning approach compared to classical segmentation methods, focusing on how user input impacts segmentation quality. The findings indicate that a hybrid method involving user interaction and deep learning can achieve high-quality results, especially when an adequate number of hints are provided."

- title: "Evolving NPC Behaviors in Games with Genetic Programming"
  description: "This paper explores the use of genetic programming to evolve behaviour trees for NPCs in a 2D top-down arena shooter. By using high-level action definitions, the approach generates adaptive and complex behaviours more efficiently than traditional hand-crafted methods. The evolved behaviours outperform manually created ones by the 25th generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method"

- title: "Procedural Animation with Curl Noise on GPUs"
  description: "This project implements a basic flow system to animate a particle system in 3D using curl noise, a method for generating realistic particle flows through procedural animation of turbulent fields. The method is computationally cheaper than the physically accurate Navier-Stokes equations and is suitable for real-time applications such as games and visualizations. The project utilizes OpenCL for particle calculations, OpenGL for rendering, and various tools for runtime configuration and shader management."
